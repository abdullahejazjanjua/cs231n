# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Spring 2024
I've been taking Stanford course [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/) while studying at [GIKI](https://giki.edu.pk/). Here I have gathered my notes and solutions to assignments. The course lectures were recorded in [Spring 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk), but the assignments are from [Spring 2024](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/assignments.html). 

## Notes
I have organized the notes by assignment, including related helpers that were instrumental in solving the assignments. The notes also feature handwritten derivations and hand-drawn diagrams of backpropagation.
