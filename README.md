# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Spring 2024
I've been taking Stanford course [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/). Here I gathered my notes and solutions to assignments. The course lectures were recorded in Spring 2017, but the assignments are from Spring 2024.
