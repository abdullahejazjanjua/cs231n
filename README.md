# Introduction

I've been taking Stanford course [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/) while studying at [GIKI](https://giki.edu.pk/). Here I have gathered my notes and solutions to assignments. The course lectures were recorded in [Spring 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk), but the assignments are from [Spring 2024](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/assignments.html). 

## Notes
I have organized the notes by assignment, including related helpers that were instrumental in solving the assignments. The notes also feature handwritten derivations and hand-drawn diagrams of backpropagation.

## Helpful Resources

- [Backpropagation for Batch Normalization](https://kratzert.github.io/2016/02/12/understanding-the-gradient-flow-through-the-batch-normalization-layer.html)
  - Helped solidify my understanding of backpropagation
- [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest)
  - Assisted in understanding concepts that were not fully clear from the course lectures
